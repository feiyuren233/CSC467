Variables Bonus ------------------------ pg7 [1]
Add a isAssigned element to Symbol, and set true if a variable is assigned in construction, or once an assignmenet statement is found. If that variable is used, check the isAssigned parameter and report error if it's not set.

Initialization ------------------------- pg6 [2]
I have set constExpr for literals, and propagated it. If a variable isConst, it's also a constExpr, so set this up. Then for initialization of const variables just check that expression is constExpr.

Function & Constructor Calls ----------- pg6 [3]
[3] Need extra information from Arguments to be able to fully type check the functions. That is, to check that they take Arguments with a specific number of expressions (notably 1 or 2). Arguments has to somehow know the number of expressions it has. -Try starting Arguments with the base type of the first m_expression and vec_size=1, and adding as it goes one, and checking that the base type is still the same and vec_size <= 4
